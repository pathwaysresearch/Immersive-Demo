Meher Batra — The Banker (Anvaya Insurance: Building the Third Act) Five years in retail banking, a credit scorecard builder, and a fresh ISB MBA. You understand financial services — but insurance is a different animal. You'll need to unlearn some banking assumptions as you learn to think in decades, not quarters. Best suited if your background is in banking, financial services, or analytics and you want to stretch into adjacent domains.
