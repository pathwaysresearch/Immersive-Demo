SCENARIO SIMULATION CASE
Neev Insurance: The Human Layer
You Can’t Help People Learn What You Don’t Understand Yourself
Nagarro BFSI Practice  |  Learning & Development  |  Interactive simulation

Your Mentor: Sasha Iyer
Sasha Iyer has spent twenty-two years in insurance and can tell you exactly when strategy becomes real: the moment someone on the third floor has to change how they do their job. Actuary in Detroit, strategy lead at three insurers, turnaround specialist at a health insurance company—Sasha came back to India last year because, as Sasha puts it, “I spent two decades watching brilliant strategies fail because nobody thought about the humans inside the machine. The engineers built the systems. The MBAs built the business cases. And the actual people who had to change their behaviour were treated as an afterthought. That’s where transformation dies. And that,” Sasha adds, pointing a pen in your direction, “is why you’re more important to this engagement than you think.”


You
Your name is Zoya Mirza, and most days you feel like you’ve wandered into someone else’s party and accidentally become essential to it.
You grew up in Lajpat Nagar, Delhi, in a family where career paths were either engineering, medicine, or a lengthy explanation at every family gathering. You chose the lengthy explanation. At Delhi University, you studied psychology because you were fascinated by why people do irrational things with complete confidence. Then English literature, because novels had been answering that question for centuries. Then a diploma in Education from Jamia, because you realized you cared less about understanding people than about helping them understand themselves.
You taught for two years in Saket, ran a reading programme for adolescents, then stumbled into corporate learning when a friend asked if you could design a “critical thinking” workshop. You could. Freelance contracts followed, then a message from Nagarro’s HR head: “We need someone who understands how adults actually learn.”
You are now Learning Development Coordinator for Nagarro’s BFSI practice: helping very smart people learn things they don’t know they need to learn, in domains they assume they already understand. The consultants know technology. The engineers know code. But when the client’s problem is a business model question, they freeze. Your job is to make sure they don’t. The catch: you need to understand the question yourself first. You don’t have an MBA. But you know something the others sometimes forget—that every transformation is, underneath the spreadsheets, a story about people changing what they believe and what they’re willing to let go of. You’ve been studying that story your entire life.


Neev Insurance
Neev General Insurance was founded in 2000 and has grown into one of India’s significant health and motor insurers: 13.5 million active policies, 260 branches, 9,200 agents, bancassurance partnerships with three major banks. Gross written premium: ₹10,800 crore. The name means “foundation” in Hindi, which the marketing team loves and which is about to become ironic, because the foundation is exactly what’s being questioned.


The CEO: Noor Jahan
Noor Jahan has led Neev for thirteen years with what one board member calls “uncomfortable foresight”—making changes before the market forces them, which means the organization spends a lot of time grumbling about initiatives that turn out to have been exactly right. Under Noor, Neev has already lived two reinventions. The first era (2000–2011) was pure product manufacturing: standardized policies, agent distribution, cost-based pricing. The second (2012–2022) layered digital services around the product—automated underwriting, claims apps, AI pricing. The policy didn’t change; the experience around it did. NPS climbed. Tech spend: ₹350 crore.
Now Noor wants the third act: a platform connecting policyholders to health and mobility services—e-pharmacies, telemedicine, fitness programs, chronic care management, roadside assistance. Insurance becomes one node in a network Neev orchestrates. Noor’s pitch to the board: “We talk to health customers 2.1 times a year. A fitness app talks to them twice a day. Whoever owns the daily relationship will own the insurance decision. I intend for that to be us.”


Why This Lands on Your Desk
Nagarro’s engagement with Neev spans strategy, technology, and change management. The consultants are mapping business models. The engineers are scoping platform architecture. And then there’s the part nobody planned for: the 9,200 agents, underwriters, claims teams, and regional managers who will need to work differently. They need to understand why the company is changing and what the new model looks like. They need to learn concepts—platforms, ecosystems, network effects—that nobody in their career has ever asked them to think about.
That’s your job. But you can’t design learning for concepts you don’t understand. So before you build anything for Neev’s people, you need to walk through the same strategic terrain the consultants are navigating. Sasha has volunteered to guide you.


The Numbers (Translated)
Sasha handed you this table: “You’ll need to understand these before you can help anyone else. Don’t panic. I’ve added translations.”
Metric
Value
What It Means
Gross Written Premium
₹10,800 Cr
Total premiums collected. Think of it as annual revenue from selling protection.
Combined Ratio
97.6%
Below 100% = company earns profit just from insurance, before investing the money. Neev is profitable.
Retention Rate
80%
4 out of 5 health customers renew. They’re staying, but 1 in 5 is walking away every year.
Customer Touchpoints / Yr
2.1
Neev talks to customers twice a year. That’s it. This is the number Noor wants to change.
Agent Network
9,200
Real people whose livelihoods depend on the current model. The human cost of change.
Dividends (Last 5 Yrs)
Record high
The company has never returned more money to shareholders. Things are going well.
P/E Ratio (5-Yr Trend)
27x → 16x
The stock market values Neev’s future less every year, even as profits grow. Investors don’t believe the growth story.


When Noor announced the platform vision at an investor event, the stock fell 4.3%. An analyst wrote: “Neev’s discipline is its moat. Platform experiments introduce uncertainty we can’t price.” Noor sent the note to the team: “This is what we’re asking 9,200 people to walk into. If we can’t explain why it’s worth it, they won’t walk.” That sentence is why Sasha thinks you’re the right person for this. The consultants build the strategy. The engineers build the platform. Someone needs to build the understanding.


The Five Decisions You Need to Understand
Sasha will walk you through five strategic questions the consulting team is tackling. You’re not expected to solve them like an MBA. You’re expected to understand them deeply enough to design learning that helps Neev’s people grasp what’s changing and why. Your psychology is an asset: every decision involves humans clinging to what they know. Your literature background is an asset: every transformation is a narrative with protagonists and a turning point. Your education training is the whole point: someone has to make this learnable.
Decision 1: What is the business model transformation—and how does the revenue model shift across Neev’s three eras?
Decision 2: Why transform now, when the company is profitable and there is no crisis?
Decision 3: What capabilities must Neev build for ecosystem play?
Decision 4: How should AI reshape the way work gets organized?
Decision 5: What forces resist transformation—and how does Neev navigate them?

Sasha settles into a chair. “Alright, Zoya. I’m not starting with revenue models. You studied psychology. You’ve watched people resist learning things that would obviously help them. So tell me: why do people hold on to ways of doing things even when the evidence says those ways are failing?”

You know this one. Loss aversion. Identity attachment. The sunk cost of expertise.

“Good,” Sasha says. “Now imagine that’s not a person. It’s a company with 9,200 employees and ₹10,800 crore in revenue. Same psychology. Bigger stakes.”

The simulation begins.
