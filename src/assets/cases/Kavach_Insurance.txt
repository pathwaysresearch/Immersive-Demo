Your Mentor: Sasha Iyer
Sasha Iyer has the kind of résumé that makes LinkedIn recruiters weep with joy and then quietly close the tab, knowing they’ll never land this one.
Born in Hyderabad, shipped off to the University of Michigan at eighteen (“My parents believed distance builds character. I believe it built frequent flyer miles”), Sasha studied economics, discovered a knack for insurance mathematics, and stayed for an MBA at Ross. What followed was twenty-two years in the American insurance industry—first as an actuary who could actually explain things at dinner parties, then as a strategy lead who dragged two regional carriers through digital overhauls, and finally as president of a specialty health insurer that tripled its policyholder base in four years.
Last year, Nagarro persuaded Sasha to come home. The pitch: help build a generation of consultants who can walk into a boardroom and tell a CEO, with evidence and tact, that their business model has an expiration date. Sasha accepted, partly for the mission and partly because, and this is a direct quote, “I missed masala dosa and I’d run out of excuses not to come back.”
Sasha is now your mentor on the Kavach engagement. The ground rules are simple: Sasha will push you, question you, and occasionally make you uncomfortable. But every push has a purpose. “I’m not here to give you answers,” Sasha told you on day one. “I’m here to make sure you’re asking the right questions before you walk into Kavach’s boardroom.”


You
Your name is Kiran Awasthi. You grew up in Pitampura, Delhi, survived the chaos of Delhi University’s North Campus, and graduated with an economics degree and an inexplicable loyalty to the college canteen’s bread pakora. An MBA at FMS taught you to think in frameworks. Three years at a Bangalore tech company taught you that frameworks break on contact with reality. Nagarro’s BFSI practice gave you the chance to do both at once.
You’re seven months into the job, and you’ve been assigned to your biggest engagement yet: helping Kavach Insurance think through a transformation that could redefine the company. Sasha is your mentor. The CEO is expecting strategic clarity. You’re expected to deliver it.


Kavach Insurance
Kavach General Insurance was founded in 1996. Over twenty-eight years it has grown into one of India’s established players in health and motor insurance: 16 million active policies, 310 branches, 11,000 agents, bancassurance partnerships with five major banks. Gross written premium last year: approximately ₹13,400 crore.
The company’s CEO is Rehan Deshpande. Rehan has led Kavach for twelve years and is known industry-wide as someone who makes bold moves before the market forces them. Under Rehan’s leadership, Kavach has already navigated two major strategic shifts. A third is now underway.


A Company in Three Acts
Act I: The Product Machine (1996–2010)
Kavach began as a classic insurance manufacturer. Standardized products—motor, health, fire, liability—sold through a growing agent network. Revenue came from fixed-price annual premiums. The business model optimized for cost: keep claims ratios predictable, push distribution volume, minimize per-policy expenses. The company hired actuaries, trained agents, and filed products with IRDAI. That was the business.
Act II: Product Plus Services (2011–2021)
When Rehan took over in 2012, the first move was digitizing operations. Automated underwriting cut quote turnaround from two days to nine minutes. A mobile app gave customers real-time claims tracking. AI-powered risk models incorporated new variables—lifestyle data, geographic health patterns, wearable inputs—to sharpen pricing. The value proposition expanded: not just a policy, but a service experience around it. NPS rose from 29 to 54. Kavach invested ₹410 crore in technology over the decade. Revenue remained premium-driven, but value-based pricing—justified by demonstrably better experiences—replaced pure cost-based pricing.
Act III: The Platform Question (2022–Present)
Rehan now wants Kavach to become a health and mobility ecosystem platform—connecting policyholders with e-pharmacies, fitness trackers, telemedicine providers, preventive wellness programs, and roadside assistance networks. The pitch to the board: “We talk to our health customers twice a year. A fitness app talks to them twice a day. If we don’t own the daily relationship, someone else will own the insurance decision.”
But this isn’t just a product launch. It’s a business model transformation—new revenue streams, new capabilities, new partnerships, new organizational structures. And it’s happening while the current business is performing well, which makes the case for change harder to make, not easier.


The Competitive Landscape
Three forces are reshaping the market simultaneously.
Regulatory acceleration. IRDAI’s “Use and File” policy now lets insurers launch products without prior approval. Bundled insurance options and sandbox frameworks have opened the door to rapid experimentation. New entrants can design, price, and ship a product in weeks.
Insurgent competition. A Bangalore-based startup offers bite-sized health plans for gig workers at ₹99/month. A Mumbai fintech bundles motor insurance into its ride-sharing app. Neither has branches or agents. Both are growing at 60%+ annually. Their products are simpler, cheaper, and worse on traditional metrics—but they’re reaching customers Kavach has never served.
Big Tech adjacency. A major e-commerce platform has quietly begun offering group health insurance to its seller network—bundled free with premium marketplace subscriptions. They already own the merchant relationship. Insurance is a feature, not a product.

The last two rows tell a story worth understanding. Kavach’s fundamentals have never been stronger. But when Rehan presented the platform vision at a recent investor day, the stock slipped 3.8%. One analyst’s note read: “We value Kavach for underwriting discipline. Platform experiments introduce margin risk we can’t model.”
Rehan forwarded the note to the transformation team with a single line: “This is what we’re up against.”


What You’re Walking Into
Your mentor Sasha will walk you through five strategic decisions that will shape Kavach’s transformation. Each one requires you to sift through information, weigh trade-offs, and arrive at a recommendation—the kind you’d present in Rehan’s boardroom.
Decision 1: What is the business model transformation, and how does the revenue model shift across each phase?
Decision 2: Why must Kavach transform now, when there is no crisis?
Decision 3: What capabilities must be built for ecosystem play—and in what sequence?
Decision 4: How should AI reshape the organization’s work architecture?
Decision 5: What structural forces constrain transformation—and how does Kavach navigate them?

Sasha leans back, coffee in hand, and says: “Alright, Kiran. Before we get into any of this—tell me something. What exactly is Kavach selling today? Not what they think they’re selling. What are customers actually buying?”

The simulation begins.
