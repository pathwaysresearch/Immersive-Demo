The Vihan Health Pivot
From Policies to Platforms: An Insurance Giant’s Reinvention
Nagarro BFSI Practice  |  For Business Analyst role  |  ~60 min discussion

You
Your name is Kiran Awasthi, and you have a talent for being in exactly the right place at exactly the wrong time.
You grew up in Rajouri Garden, Delhi, where your first act of business analysis was reverse-engineering your mother’s rajma recipe into a spreadsheet at age fourteen. She was not impressed. You were. The spreadsheet had conditional formatting.
You studied economics at Delhi University, where you discovered that you loved pulling patterns out of messy data and that the canteen samosa was a more reliable indicator of campus sentiment than any survey. An MBA at FMS followed, then three years at a tech firm in Bangalore where you learned that “agile” is both a methodology and what you need to be when your auto-rickshaw driver treats traffic rules as philosophical suggestions.
Then Nagarro called. The BFSI practice needed someone who could sit across from a bank CTO, understand the architecture diagram, and then explain it to a business head using only analogies and hand gestures. Seven months in, you’ve helped a mid-size bank redesign its onboarding flow and worked on a payments integration. Now, your practice lead has assigned you to something bigger—a strategic transformation engagement with one of India’s established general insurers.
This is the kind of problem that makes you forget to eat lunch. You’re in.


The Company and Its Architect
Vihan General Insurance was founded in 1997, back when “digital strategy” meant having a website. Over twenty-seven years, it has grown into a major player in health and motor insurance, with over 14 million active policies and a distribution network spanning 280 branches, 9,000 agents, and partnerships with four major banks. Annual gross written premium: approximately ₹11,200 crore.
The person who has shaped most of this journey is Noor Kapadia, Vihan’s CEO for the past eleven years. Noor has the unusual distinction of being described as “visionary” by the business press and “tireless menace” by their own operations team—both meant as compliments. Noor grew up in Surat, studied engineering at NIT Surat, picked up an MBA from IIM Lucknow, and has spent an entire career in insurance. Noor’s leadership style combines spreadsheet discipline with philosophical wandering. Board presentations begin with unit economics and end with questions like, “Are we even in the insurance business anymore, or are we in the trust business?”
Under Noor’s watch, Vihan has already undergone two major transformations—and is now staring at a third.


Phase 1: The Product Era (1997–2011)
For its first fourteen years, Vihan operated a straightforward merchant model. It manufactured standardized insurance products—motor, health, fire, liability—and distributed them through agents and bancassurance partners. Revenue came from fixed-price annual premiums, with the profit formula optimizing for cost: keep claims ratios stable, minimize expenses, grow the agent network. Key resources were actuarial models, agent relationships, and regulatory licenses. Key processes were underwriting, issuance, and claims settlement.
This worked. Vihan grew steadily. But by 2010, Noor—then heading product strategy—noticed something troubling: health insurance customers interacted with Vihan exactly twice. Once when they bought the policy. Once when they filed a claim. For the other 363 days, Vihan was invisible.


Phase 2: Product Plus Services (2012–2020)
When Noor became CEO in 2013, the first initiative was “Project Pulse”: digitizing operations and layering services around the core product. Automated underwriting reduced quote turnaround from 48 hours to 11 minutes. A mobile app let customers track claims in real time. AI-driven pricing models used fourteen new variables to price health policies more precisely.
The business model shifted. Value was no longer just the policy; it included the speed and quality of services surrounding it. Customer NPS jumped from 32 to 58 over five years. The company invested ₹340 crore in technology between 2015 and 2020.
But then IRDAI introduced “Use and File” regulations, allowing insurers to launch products without prior approval. Agile new entrants—startups with no branches and no legacy systems—could design and distribute products in weeks. A Bangalore startup launched bite-sized health insurance for gig workers. A Mumbai fintech bundled motor insurance into a ride-sharing app. These companies weren’t better at what Vihan did. They were playing a different game.


Phase 3: The Platform Question (2021–Present)
This is where you come in.
Noor has assembled a transformation team and brought Nagarro on board to help think through what Vihan calls “Vihan 3.0.” The ambition is to move from being a product-and-services company to becoming a health and mobility ecosystem platform—connecting customers not just to insurance, but to e-pharmacy providers, fitness tracking apps, telemedicine services, preventive health programs, and roadside assistance networks.
The logic, as Noor explains it in your first briefing: “We interact with health insurance customers twice a year. A fitness app interacts with them twice a day. Whoever owns the daily relationship will eventually own the insurance decision. I’d rather that be us.”
The envisioned platform would connect consumers on one side with healthcare and mobility service providers on the other. Vihan would orchestrate the ecosystem, earning revenue through multiple streams: insurance premiums, referral commissions from partners, data-driven product recommendations, and subscription fees for wellness programs. The model promises richer data, broader touchpoints, engagement beyond annual renewals, and access to underserved segments—gig workers, young professionals, rural populations—who find traditional insurance irrelevant or inaccessible.
On paper, it’s compelling. In practice, it terrifies half the leadership team.


Your Assignment
Your practice lead at Nagarro has asked you to prepare a structured analysis to support Noor’s transformation team. Specifically, you are reviewing the following decisions:
The Business Model Shift. What exactly changes when Vihan moves from merchant to platform? Map the transformation across all four business model components—value proposition, profit formula, key resources, key processes—for each phase. Where does value migrate? What gets commoditized? What becomes the new source of differentiation?
The Timing Question. Vihan is profitable. Market share is stable. There is no crisis. So why transform now? Regulatory shifts like Use and File are opening the door to new entrants. Tech-savvy startups are redefining customer expectations. Capital availability is lowering entry barriers. Are these genuinely disruptive forces—or can Vihan simply improve its current model faster than competitors erode it?
The Capability Gap. Becoming a platform requires capabilities Vihan doesn’t have: strategic partnerships with healthcare and mobility providers, technology infrastructure for ecosystem integration, a customer-centric marketing engine, and an internal culture of experimentation. Which of these should Vihan build, which should it partner for, and in what sequence?
The Captivity Problem. Here is the number that haunts Noor. Over five years, Vihan tripled renewal revenue, achieved record market share in retail health, and paid its highest-ever dividend. Yet when Noor presented the Vihan 3.0 vision at an investor day, the stock dipped 4%. Analysts wrote: “We value Vihan for disciplined underwriting, not platform ambitions.” Investors reward startups for growth potential and incumbents for current profits. Transformation requires a temporary earnings dip—the J-curve—at exactly the moment investors least want one. Meanwhile, 9,000 agents worry about disintermediation, underwriters about algorithmic replacement, bancassurance partners about being cut out. Every internal system reinforces the current model. How does Vihan navigate this captivity without destroying the ₹11,200 crore business that funds the transformation?

You open your laptop, pull up a blank Miro board, and think about where to start. Noor’s briefing ended with a line that stuck with you: “The hardest part isn’t knowing what must change. It’s that everything that made us successful is now what’s holding us back.”

Your rajma spreadsheet was simpler than this. But the instinct is the same: pull the system apart, see how the pieces connect, and figure out which ones need to move.
